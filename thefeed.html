                    Like most people I also do most of my school related work on my computer. This is a screenshot of my Design for the Web Class meeting on Zoom. Would not recommend learning to code via zoom.

                    Been having a lot of schoolwork recently. This is an image of one of my least favorite forms of this, dozens of pages of notes. On my computer of course.

                    I live off campus, so I take the 31 bus to and from the Inner Richmond most days to get to a from class. I use the Transit app and Apple Maps mostly.

                    Like I said, I spend a lot of time listening to music. Here's a screenshot of my Spotify desktop app. I use this a lot when I'm working on my computer.

                    Being a design major, I spend a lot of time on computers and using various technologies and programs to do most of my work. Featured here is a picture of Adobe Illustrator, something I used a lot for one of my last projects. I also utilized the printers and scanners located in the computer lab to add in some textures of my own for this project.

                    I use a lot of tech to run my KUSF show. Most of the time it's done via Spotify on my computer connected to the system pictured, however I also make use of the CD player and turntable in the studio. Tune into The Treasure Trove on Monday's 4:30-6:00.

                    I also spend a lot of time thinking about and looking at clothes. This mainly manifests digitally in buying and selling online. Depop is probably my most used platform for this. Here's an image of my likes, although nothing I've bought as I try to be very picky with purchasing.

                    A lot of my daily interactions with technology revolve around music. I have been using an Ipod a got not long ago a lot recently. Here's an image of me listening to 365 by Charli XCX.

                    Physical media is big for me, so of course I have a system to listen to my personal collection at home. Pictured here is my setup of shelves with a CD player, amplifier, and speakers. In use with Love Deluxe of course. Not pictured is the record player on the shelf below.

                    I've recently been spending a lot of time archiving inspiration of all sorts within my own files. Pictured here are mostly fashion show looks I use for personal and design reference.

                    I also try to take a lot of pictures. I always have an extra camera on me, usually my blue Canon Powershot I stole from my mom. This is a picture I took of the church on campus for the sake of this assignment, including a picture of me taking said picture.
